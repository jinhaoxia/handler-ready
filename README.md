Handler-Ready
=============

This project is the method `handler-ready` proposed in the paper `An Efficient Black-Box Vulnerability Scanning Method for Web Application`.
The method `handler-ready` is designed to learn the HTTP requests' frequent patterns(so called `handler`).

The algorithms of FPClose and CM-Clasp are imported from SPMF http://www.philippe-fournier-viger.com/spmf/index.php .
